## Dataset
UR-FUNNY dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/ROC-HCI/UR-FUNNY). humor_dataloader.py provides dataloader for the dataset.


## Code
* punchline_detection.ipynb is a collab notebook containing the implementation of context-aware hierarchical model and code to train the model.
* Download UR-FUNNY dataset from the aforementioned link and upload it to your drive.
* Change drive paths appropriately to make sure the data is being read correctly.
* pretrained_weights folder contains pretrained bimodal and trimodal models.
